# Timeoff Central: v2

Timeoff Central is a system used to manage leave and attendance records. The first version, which
was a demo build, focused fully on leave and attendance records and was a preview to be used in a 
company for testing and feedback collection.

This second version will feature proper communication streams, better functionality and UI that works
for both management and employees. The system will also be optimized for scalability and flexibility.

## Key features
- **Proper communication streams**: Notifications and emails can be coordinated through the system to ensure
management and employees are alerted whenever they request for leaves (and receiving various information.)
- **Better functionality**: Functions and operations have been optimized to work better than in the previous
system.
- **Better UI**: Overall better UI looks
